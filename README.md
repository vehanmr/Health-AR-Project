# Health-AR-Project

This project presents a web application that uses the internet of things (IoT) to remotely
monitor heart rate, body balance, and hand motion. This web application was built by using various
components such as a pulse sensor, MPU9250 sensor and Node MCU. The experimental results
of the implemented prototype were confirmed to be accurate, as the system was able to sense
and read the user's data and broadcast it via the internet.
These findings are helps to check Air Rifle Shooters' health. Additionally, this website application
proposes a flexible, dependable, and confidential solution for monitoring heartbeat rate, hand
motion and body balancing using sensors and IoT technologies that may be applied in the
medical industry to help medical practitioners accomplish their jobs more efficiently.
